After I visited the site, I went ahead and used the payload adminâ€™ # on the username field and then put some gibberish data on the password field  and was able to log in. I got my payload from [PayloadAllThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/MySQL%20Injection.md#mysql-error-based).

And just like that, we were able to pawn the machine .
