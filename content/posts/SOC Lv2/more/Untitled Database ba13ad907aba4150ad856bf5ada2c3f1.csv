,"Parsing
                        

                            Parsing is breaking down the log data into 
more manageable and understandable components. Since logs come in 
various formats depending on the source, it's essential to parse these 
logs to extract valuable information.",https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/b92ca5757d85ab49ee32cb0217b84b3a.svg

                            Normalisation is standardising parsed data. 
It involves bringing the various log data into a standard format, making
 comparing and analysing data from different sources easier. It is 
imperative in environments with multiple systems and applications, where
 each might generate logs in another format.",https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/6d50d78e6c09b878bc4bf6aebf73b7a9.svg
,"Sorting
                        

                            Sorting is a vital aspect of log analysis, 
as it allows for efficient data retrieval and identification of 
patterns. Logs can be sorted by time, source, event type, severity, and 
any other parameter present in the data. Proper sorting is critical in 
identifying trends and anomalies that signal operational issues or 
security incidents.

,"Classification
                        

                            Classification involves assigning categories
 to the logs based on their characteristics. By classifying log files, 
you can quickly filter and focus on those logs that matter most to your 
analysis. For instance, classification can be based on the severity 
level, event type, or source. Automated classification using machine 
learning can significantly enhance this process, helping to identify 
potential issues or threats that could be overlooked.

,"Enrichment
                        

                            Log enrichment adds context to logs to make 
them more meaningful and easier to analyse. It could involve adding 
information like geographical data, user details, threat intelligence, 
or even data from other sources that can provide a complete picture of 
the event.
                        

                            Enrichment makes logs more valuable, 
enabling analysts to make better decisions and more accurately respond 
to incidents. Like classification, log enrichment can be automated using
 machine learning, reducing the time and effort required for log 
analysis.

 and identifying connections between log entries. This process helps 
detect patterns and trends, making understanding complex relationships 
between various log events easier. Correlation is critical in 
determining security threats or system performance issues that might 
remain unnoticed.

graphical formats like charts, graphs, or heat maps. Visually presenting
 data makes recognising patterns, trends, and anomalies easier. 
Visualisation tools provide an intuitive way to interpret large volumes 
of log data, making complex information more accessible and
