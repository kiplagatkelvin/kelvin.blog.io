"Cultivating a culture of learning and vigilance is a
 top-down initiative. Executive management must prioritise and invest in
 cyber security, setting clear expectations for following the correct 
procedures.
                
                    Regular education and awareness campaigns can equip 
personnel to identify and report suspicious activity or technical 
anomalies they may encounter, contributing to the overall effectiveness 
of the incident response process.
                
                    Moreover, comprehensive policies and procedures 
related to incident response and reporting, guided by legal counsel, can
 underscore the importance of following the right procedures in 
identifying security incidents and communicating them effectively, 
thereby alerting the relevant people with the necessary information that
 will enable them to address issues.",,https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/3d728e95c7050365fef8874b492a23f5.svg
