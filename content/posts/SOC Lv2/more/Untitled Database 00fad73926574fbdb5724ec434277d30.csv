,"1. Event Notification
                            

                                The loop begins when an issue has been 
reported. It triggers the incident response process and sets the stage 
for the subsequent steps.
                            
2. Documentation
                            

                                The underlying issue is documented in 
detail, including information about the nature of the incident, the 
systems affected, and any potential threats or vulnerabilities. 
Documentation is a critical step that provides a foundation for the rest
 of the process.
                            
3. Evidence Collection
                            

                                Evidence of the incident is collected, 
including log files, network traffic data, and other relevant 
information. The collected evidence provides valuable insights into the 
incident and helps identify potential threats.
                            
4. Artefact Identification
                            

                                The collected evidence is analysed to 
identify artefacts related to the incident. These artefacts can provide 
clues about the threat's nature and the damage's extent.
                            
5. Pivot Point Discovery
                            

                                Based on the identified artefacts, new 
areas of investigation may be discovered. These pivot points can lead to
 new insights and help further refine the incident's scope. After this 
step, the process loops back to the documentation phase, incorporating 
the new findings.",https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/c515da92a62bbd1dc087db0ac1f10eb7.svg
