**1. Introduction**

As IoT and SCADA devices become increasingly integral to modern
businesses, they also introduce significant security risks. CyberTech
Solutions must address the potential vulnerabilities posed by these
devices. This network segmentation plan aims to mitigate the risk of IoT
and SCADA devices being compromised and protect critical business
systems by implementing a secure and isolated network architecture.

**2. Assessment of IoT and SCADA Risks**

CyberTech Solutions utilizes IoT and SCADA devices for operational
efficiency and real-time data processing. However, these devices can be
vulnerable to several risks, such as:

-   **Unpatched firmware**: Leaving devices exposed to known
    vulnerabilities.
-   **Insecure communication protocols**: Use of non-encrypted or
    easily intercepted communication channels.
-   **Weak authentication**: Many IoT and SCADA devices rely on default
    credentials or have inadequate authentication mechanisms.]{#4e73}
-   **Lack of network isolation**: IoT and SCADA devices are often on
    the same network as critical business systems, increasing the risk
    of lateral attacks.

If compromised, these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized control
of SCADA systems, operational disruption, data theft, or malware spread
across critical business networks.

**3. Proposed Network Segmentation Plan**

To address these risks, we propose the following network architecture
that isolates IoT and SCADA devices from the core business network. The
segmentation will help ensure that if IoT or SCADA systems are
compromised, attackers cannot gain access to sensitive business systems.

**3.1 VLAN Architecture**

We recommend segregating IoT and SCADA devices into their own Virtual
Local Area Networks (VLANs). Each VLAN will be dedicated to specific
device groups:

-   **VLAN 1**: IoT devices
-   **VLAN 2**: SCADA devices
-   **VLAN 3**: Critical business systems

The VLAN architecture will ensure that devices on different networks
cannot communicate directly with one another, thus limiting the
potential spread of malware or attacks.

**3.2 Firewalls and Access Controls**

To further isolate these networks, we will implement firewall rules that
control and restrict traffic between the VLANs:

-   **Internal Segmentation Firewall (ISFW)**: This firewall will be
    positioned between the IoT, SCADA, and business system VLANs. It
    will block all unnecessary communication, only allowing specific
    traffic such as device updates, monitoring data, or authorized user
    access.
-   **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: These ACLs will be configured to
    ensure that only authorized devices and users can access the IoT and
    SCADA VLANs. Furthermore, only essential services and protocols,
    such as HTTPS for device communication, will be allowed between
    VLANs.

**3.3 Network Access Control (NAC)**

NAC solutions will be deployed to prevent unauthorized devices from
connecting to the IoT or SCADA VLANs. All devices will be subject to
authentication and posture assessment, ensuring only compliant devices
are permitted to connect.

**3.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

To minimize insider threats, RBAC will be implemented to control user
access. Only authorized personnel with specific roles will have access
to IoT or SCADA systems. The RBAC policy will also enforce the principle
of least privilege.

**4. Traffic Control and Monitoring**

Monitoring and controlling network traffic is crucial to maintaining
security. The following strategies will be employed to manage traffic
flow between VLANs and detect any potential threats:

-   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: IDS/IPS
    solutions will be deployed within the IoT and SCADA VLANs to detect
    any suspicious traffic or attempted breaches. These systems will
    alert security personnel to any anomalous activity.
-   **Logging and Auditing**: Firewalls, switches, and other network
    devices will log all traffic between VLANs. These logs will be
    analyzed to detect patterns indicative of security issues.
-   **Regular Network Audits**: Periodic network security audits will
    be conducted to ensure that segmentation and access controls are
    functioning as intended.

**5. Conclusion**

By isolating IoT and SCADA devices in dedicated VLANs, restricting their
communication with critical business systems using firewalls, and
employing robust monitoring and control measures, CyberTech Solutions
can significantly reduce the risk of attacks originating from
compromised IoT or SCADA devices. This network segmentation plan
provides a comprehensive strategy to secure CyberTech's network
infrastructure and safeguard its operations.
