**2. Scan Details**

**vulnerability scan report**

### Introduction {#f175 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="f175"}

This report outlines the results of a network vulnerability scan
conducted on the system with IP address 192.168.238.135 using Nmap. The
goal is to identify any potential vulnerabilities by checking open
ports, services, and version details.

### 2. Scope of the Scan {#c24a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c24a"}

• **Target**:

The target of the IP Adress was my ip address which was generated from
ifconfig.

• **Type of Scan**:

Included more of overall scan to detect all vulnerabilities for now in
my system,service detection, or vulnerability script).

I started by installing my Nmap and expected result were us follows

I did more of service detection **nmap -sV**

I

I also detected vulnerabilities using the scripts(nmap --- scripts vuln
192.168.238.135)

The scan was conducted on the host 192.168.1.1 at 10:00 AM on Sept 22
2024. Nmap was used to perform a port and service scan with version
detection enabled to identify running services and potential
vulnerabilities.

### 3. Scan Results Overview {#ea52 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ea52"}

The scan revealed a total of 1 open ports on the target system and the
rest were closed, Among the services detected, no vulnerabilities were
identified, related to an outdated SSH service and an unpatched HTTP
service.

### 4. Detailed Findings (overall detailed finding after the scan) {#5f8c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="5f8c"}

The details above were the overall finding after my convertion to an xml
format to afile after doing more of aggressive scan.This will enable us
to do more of convertions to html.

nmap -A -T4 -oX scan.xml 192.168.238.135

### 5. Vulnerability Analysis and Recommendations {#939b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="939b"}

The version of OpenSSH running on port 22 is known to be vulnerable to
CVE-2016--0777. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the
system. It is recommended to update OpenSSH to version 7.4 or higher to
mitigate this vulnerability. Consider configuring additional security
measures such as keybased authentication.

### 6. Conclusion {#ff1e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ff1e"}

Nmap is the best tool so far but I will still be working on openvas to
see the differences and easy way forward.

In conclusion, the system at 192.168.238.135 had no vulnerabilities that
needed immediate attention, particularly the outdated SSH and HTTP
services. It is highly recommended to keep patching these
vulnerabilities and implement additional security measures such as a
firewall to block unused ports.

This report also considers additional information based on previous
vulnerability assessments (detailed in the attached document) conducted
on a similar system. A network scan using Nmap revealed no critical
issues but identified an outdated SSH service. Immediate attention to
SSH and HTTP vulnerabilities, as well as regular patching, is strongly
recommended to prevent potential risks​(vulnerability scan repo...).
