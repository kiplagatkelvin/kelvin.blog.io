## 2. Scan Details

### Introduction {#introduction}

This report outlines the results of a network vulnerability scan conducted on the system with IP address `192.168.238.135` using **Nmap**. The goal is to identify any potential vulnerabilities by checking open ports, services, and version details.

### Scope of the Scan {#scope}

- **Target:**  
  The target IP address was generated from `ifconfig`.

- **Type of Scan:**  
  An overall scan was performed to detect vulnerabilities, service detection, and script-based analysis.

#### Commands Used:
```sh
nmap -sV  # Service detection
nmap --script vuln 192.168.238.135  # Vulnerability scanning
nmap -A -T4 -oX scan.xml 192.168.238.135  # Aggressive scan with XML output
```

## 3. Scan Results Overview {#results-overview}

The scan revealed **1 open port** on the target system while the rest were closed. Among the services detected, **outdated SSH and HTTP services** were identified as vulnerabilities.

## 4. Detailed Findings {#detailed-findings}

The scan results were converted to XML format to facilitate further analysis and HTML-based reporting.

## 5. Vulnerability Analysis and Recommendations {#vulnerability-analysis}

### Identified Vulnerability:
- **Service:** OpenSSH (Port 22)
- **CVE:** CVE-2016-0777
- **Risk:** Unauthorized access potential
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade OpenSSH to version 7.4 or higher and implement key-based authentication.

## 6. Conclusion {#conclusion}

Nmap is an effective scanning tool, but additional assessments with **OpenVAS** will be conducted to compare results. The system at `192.168.238.135` requires updates for SSH and HTTP services. Regular patching and firewall implementation are recommended.
